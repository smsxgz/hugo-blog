## About this blog  
The main topics of this blog will include:  
- Mathematics: optimization, probability and combinatorics,  
- reinforcement learning,  
- puzzles: logical puzzles and primary Euclidean geometry,  
- algorithms: some interesting problem from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/),  
- something just for fun.  

I will try my best to write this blog in English and to post articles as much as possible.

## About me  
My nickname is smsxgz. 'SMS' is an abbreviation of my undergraduate college.
Although I have graduated, I don't want to change my nickname and I love it.  
(For pronouncing easily, you also can call me Ivan.)
